  <Accordion title="How is Woz different from other app builders?">
    **Building your app on Woz gives you a robust foundation that you can continue building upon long in to the future. **

    Think of Woz as a true business partner, not just a tool. Not only does Woz help you design your app, it builds, deploys, hosts, and maintains real production software. From day one, we engineer security, scalability, and stability into every app, setting you and your business up for long-term success. Plus, our human experts are available to guide you when needed.
